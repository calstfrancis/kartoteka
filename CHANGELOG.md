# Changelog

All notable changes to Kartoteka are recorded here. Kartoteka is part of the Fond suite.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased (Milestone 1: the vault)

The headless vault. No UI, no network, no PDFs yet (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`).

### Added

- **Cargo workspace** with the crate split from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: `fond-bib`,
  `fond-vault`, `fond-doc` (stub), `fond-index` (stub), and `kartoteka-cli`. Shared
  `fond-*` crates are MIT; the app crate is proprietary.
- **`fond-bib`** — the on-disk library model:
  - One-key-per-file `entries/<key>.yml`, kept as pure Hayagriva.
  - `notes/<key>.md` with YAML frontmatter (tags, read-status, rating, dates,
    attachment records) and Markdown body; bare-body notes round-trip byte-identically.
  - `collections/<slug>.yml` ordered key lists.
  - Citation-key generation `<lastname><year><titleword>` with ASCII diacritic folding,
    leading-article stripping, and stable `b`/`c`/… collision suffixes.
  - Deterministic `library.yml` regeneration (ascending-key order), committed and always
    reproducible from `entries/`.
- **`fond-vault`** — in-process git via vendored libgit2 (never shells out): init,
  structured status, stage, commit (handles the first commit), a git-config identity
  helper, and a `notify`-based recursive watcher for the future Zerkalo live seam.
- **`kartoteka` CLI** — `init`, `add` (from file or stdin, auto-keys entries), `list`,
  `show`, `reindex`, `fsck`, `status`, `commit`; `--json` on the read commands.
- **`kartoteka fsck`** reports filename/key mismatches, unparseable entries, dangling
  collection references, and missing / orphaned / hash-mismatched attachment blobs
  (blake3), exiting non-zero when anything is found.
- **Tests** — round-trip focused: YAML in → model → YAML out stable; `library.yml`
  regeneration byte-stable and reproducible after deletion; git init → commit → local
  clone → read back; fsck detecting every seeded problem.
- **CI** on Linux and Windows (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests).
- Planning docs under `docs/`: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATA-MODEL.md`, `LICENSES.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md`.
